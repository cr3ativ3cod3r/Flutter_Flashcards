# Flutter_Flashcards


The flashcards app allows the user to navigate between sections using the buttons in the bottom navigation bar.In the flashcards there is also a button to View the answer.Swipe gestures are supported by the flashcards.The option to add new flashcards is in the drawer.There is also a delete option to delete the flashcards.

I have tried implementing the LaTex part with various libraries including flutter_tex,latext,katex etc.But none of them worked properly.It is not also showing any error, making it difficult to troubleshoot.In the lib folder I have a main.dart which has all functionalities except latex.The rest two files are the ones with latex(using different latex libraries).
